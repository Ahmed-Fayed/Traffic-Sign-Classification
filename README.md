# Traffic-Sign-Classification
I have implemented a classifier for 43 different traffic signs in 3 different methodolgies:

--> First is the Subclassing Model which uses python class to build models or submodels and inherting from keras Model Module

--> Second is the Functional Model

--> Third is the Sequential Model (in master branch)
